## Multilayer perceptron (MLP)
A 2-layer MLP for MNIST digit classfication with weights visulization implemented in TensorFlow.

Model details:
Image (784 dimensions) -> fully connected layer (500 hidden units) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> fully connected layer (100 hidden units) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> fully connected (10 hidden units) -> softmax

## Convolutional neural network (CNN)
A 2-layer CNN for MNIST digit classfication implemented in TensorFlow.

Model details:
Image -> convolution (32 5x5 filters) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> (2x2 max pool) -> convolution (64 5x5 filters) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> (2x2 max pool) -> fully connected (256 hidden units) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> fully connected (10 hidden units) -> softmax

## Reinforcement learning (RL) 

## Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
